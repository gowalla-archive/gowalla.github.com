# Boxer: Generate Sane JSON from Complex Objects

## The Problem

When you have a large API with many different types of objects distributed
across many different resources, composing and showing views of those objects
for API responses can be a challenge.

You may start out by just rendering ActiveRecord models directly to JSON:

    class Api::UsersController < ApiController
      def show
        @user = User.find(params[:id])
        render :json => @user
      end
    end

But that quickly becomes unwieldy as you want full and simple control over
which attributes are returned, and to start returning method values alongside
model attributes. So you may move on to writing `.json.erb` files, which allow
you to specify exactly what appears in a response:

    # app/views/users/show.json.erb
    <%= raw({
      :name => @user.name,
      :recent_spots => @user.recent_spots(30),
      :is_private => @user.private?
    }.to_json) %>

Though you soon find these views growing out of control, with conditionals
based on the authenticated user requesting the information, whether they're
friends, whether the user resource is a business, whether a promotion is
running, etc.

    # app/views/users/show.json.erb
    <%
      hash = {
        :name => @user.name,
        :is_private => @user.private?
      }
      if user.public?
        hash.merge!({
          :recent_spots => @user.recent_spots(30),
          :recent_highlights => @user.recent_highlights(10),
        })
      end
      if user.friends?(current_user)
        hash.merge!({
          :is_friend => true,
          :mutual_friends => user.mutual_friends(current_user).map(&:to_hash),
        })
      end
    %>
    <%= raw(hash.to_json) %>

What would be nice is a simple framework that knows about different object
representations and the various views each of those objects can have. Such
a system should let you compose objects together in responses that satisfy
the complexity of your large API.

## The Solution

[Boxer](http://github.com/gowalla/boxer) is a version of such a tool.

Instead of defining messy conditional views full of merged hashes, Boxer
provides a clean framework for describing the representation and views of
an object as hashes:

    Boxer.box(:user) do |box, user|
      box.view(:base) do
        {
          :name => user.name,
          :age  => user.age,
        }
      end

      box.view(:full, :extends => :base) do
        {
          :email      => user.email,
          :is_private => user.private?,
        }
      end
    end

Then you can "ship" the contents of a box with a model object (or any other
arguments you want to pass in) and get a JSON-ready hash:

    >> Boxer.ship(:user, User.first, :view => :full).to_json
    => "{"name": "Bo Jim", "age": 17, "email": "b@a.com", "is_private": false}"

For more examples and a more in-depth explanation, see the
[README on GitHub](https://github.com/gowalla/boxer#readme).

Boxer also goes through the trouble of solving small and common problems that
creep up when using this style of framework. Things like [preconditions][1],
[helper methods][2], [including methods for use in boxes][3] and
[multiple box inheritance][4].

We have released Boxer [as a gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/boxer) and,
as noted, an open-source project on GitHub. Let us know what interesting
uses you find for Boxer, in addition to any suggested improvements.
